# 🧠 Biomedical AI Course Project

## 🎯 Overview
This project offers an opportunity to gain **in-depth experience developing an AI-based approach** to solve a **biomedical problem**.  
Students can focus on either:
- **Methodology development**, or  
- **Deployment on new biomedical applications**

> ⚠️ Simply re-running an existing code repository is **NOT sufficient**.

---

## 💡 Project Scope & Examples

### 🔬 Example Project Types
1. **Novel Problem**
   - Develop a deep learning model for a *new problem* not previously explored.
   - Utilize a *new dataset* or tackle *new tasks* on existing data.

2. **Novel Analysis**
   - Reimplement an existing paper that you find interesting.
   - Try *algorithmic variants* to see if they improve performance.

3. **Novel Methods**
   - Propose *new algorithms or model architectures* for an existing problem.
   - Improve upon the current problem’s *measure of success*.

---

## 👥 Group Work
- Groups can have **1–2 students**.
- **Grades will be calibrated** based on group size.
- Groups must be **finalized by the proposal submission date** (cannot be changed later).
- Each group member must:
  - Submit the **proposal**, **presentation slides**, and **final report** individually on Canvas.
  - **Present together** during the final presentation.
- In the **final report**, specify the contributions of each author (discussion, implementation, writing).

> 🧩 Example format: see *Author Contributions* in [AlphaGo (Nature, 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961).

## 💻 Computing Resources
- **Great Lakes credits** will be available.
- Details to be announced in a future lecture.
